IW9 (Jupiter) Steam (SHIP 10.24 build 23098690 2025-07-08) and IW9 (Jupiter) SP Steam (SHIP 10.4 build 23098619 2025-07-08) Offline Patch v1

===============================
Instructions:
- Firstly, make sure the path on where you put the game folder is short and doesn't contain non latin characters or symbols to avoid issues with game launching.
- Extract everything in this archive into where you installed the game.
- Start the game ONLY FROM !start_cod23.bat (for MP) or !start_sp23.bat (for SP) and keep the console window open until it closes by itself when you close the game.
- If running either *.bat doesn't do anything, read the 1st step again (or check bootstrapper.log).

Default Hotkeys (Set your keyboard to US if you encounter issues) :
- Cbuf: Right Control + / (press this hotkey in the external console window)
- Noclip: Right Control + N
- God Mode: Right Control + M

To set a different keybind for each hotkeys, modify the "virtual key codes" values in _profile.ini. The decimal values for each keyboard keys can be found in many places on the internet (search query: virtual key codes).
===============================

Campaign and Multiplayer (only with bots) are fully playable offline with everything unlocked (weapons, operators, customizations, etc). However LAN is currently not possible at the moment, only local play with bots for now (so don't bother asking about LAN).

Steam notes:
This release uses a fork of GSE by alex47exe (originally created by Mr_Goldberg) for the steam emulator. You can change playername and language by editing steam_settings/configs.user.ini but make sure that you have installed the appropriate language files first.

Huge thanks to purrplee and other people for providing me with essential resources, and many thanks to every testers for making sure that this dll works as it should!

Side notes:
- Campaign missions can be unlocked all at once by enabling 'UnlockAllMissions' in sp23/_profile.ini
- If you're stuck on "Launching..." screen after starting the game, simply press Esc.
- MWZ...?
